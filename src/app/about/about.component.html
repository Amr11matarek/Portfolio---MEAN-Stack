    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Amr Matarek, a passionate software developer with expertise in Android and web applications. 
      I love building projects that make people's lives easier and contribute to the community through 
      technology. With experience in a variety of technologies including machine learning, I've worked 
      on several exciting projects like Ducks Row, Food Hup, and Wagbat.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always learning and improving my skills to help businesses and individuals solve complex problems 
      through creative and scalable solutions. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the world of Angular and full-stack 
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with family, hitting the gym to stay fit, and continuously 
      expanding my knowledge in new and emerging technologies.
